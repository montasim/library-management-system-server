/**
 * @fileoverview This module defines constants for different access types within the application.
 * It provides a standardized way to reference user roles and permissions across the codebase,
 * facilitating easier management and verification of access controls. The constants defined here
 * include 'ADMIN' for administrative access, 'USER' for regular user access, and 'BOTH' for cases
 * where functionalities are shared between admins and users. Utilizing these constants helps
 * prevent errors and inconsistencies in role-based logic throughout the application.
