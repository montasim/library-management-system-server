 * The schema ensures that the writer data conforms to specified validation rules and constraints.

 * @type {mongoose.Schema}
 * @description This schema includes fields for:
 * - name: The name of the writer (unique, required, with length constraints).
 * - image: The image of the writer (referencing a shared image schema).
 * - review: The review rating of the writer (required, with value constraints).
 * - summary: A brief summary of the writer's profile (required, with length constraints).
 * - isActive: A flag indicating whether the writer is active (referencing a shared isActive schema).
 * - createdBy: The user who created the writer record (referencing a shared createdByAdmin schema).
 * - updatedBy: The user who last updated the writer record (referencing a shared updatedByAdmin schema).
 *
 * The schema also includes:
 * - A unique index on the name field to ensure writer names are unique.
 * - Pre-save and update middleware to enforce the presence of creator/updater information.
 * - Error handling middleware for unique constraint violations.
