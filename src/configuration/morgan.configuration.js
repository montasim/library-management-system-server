/**
 * @fileoverview This module configures the morgan logger middleware for use in an Express application.
 * Morgan is a middleware that logs HTTP requests and responses, providing insights into the traffic
 * that the application handles. This configuration extends the basic functionality by customizing the
 * log format and integrating with the application's logging service. It logs various aspects of each
 * request and response, such as method, URL, status, content length, response time, referrer, and
 * user-agent. A custom token is also defined to log JSON stringified request bodies, enhancing the
 * diagnostic capabilities of the logs.
 *
 * @requires module:morgan HTTP request logger middleware for node.js.
 * @requires module:service/logger.service Custom logging service to handle log output.

/**
 * Sets up morgan to log HTTP request and response details in a custom format to the application's
 * logger service. The log output includes standard HTTP transaction details along with execution time
 * and client metadata, configured to provide a comprehensive overview of incoming requests and outgoing
 * responses. The integration with the custom logger ensures that logs are consistent with other application
 * logs and are managed according to the overall logging strategy.

 * @returns {Function} Middleware function that logs HTTP transactions.
 * @description Configures morgan logger to use a custom format and integration with the application's logging system.
