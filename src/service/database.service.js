/**
 * @fileoverview This module provides database connection services using Mongoose for MongoDB integration
 * within an Express application. It offers functions to connect to and disconnect from the MongoDB database,
 * handling various database events such as errors, disconnections, and reconnections. The service is designed
 * to ensure robust database connection management by automatically reconnecting on disconnections and
 * logging significant events related to the database connection lifecycle.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Establishing a persistent connection to MongoDB and managing reconnection attempts in case of disconnection.
 * - Gracefully disconnecting from the database when the application is shutting down or when required by the logic.
 * - Logging detailed information and errors related to database connections to assist in monitoring and troubleshooting.
 *
 * The module enhances the reliability of the application's data layer by ensuring that database connections are
 * managed efficiently and errors are handled gracefully.

/**
 * Connects to the MongoDB database using configuration settings specified in the application's configuration module.
 * This function sets up and manages a persistent connection to the database, handling connectivity issues such as
 * automatic reconnections on disconnections. It also listens to various Mongoose connection events to log different
 * statuses like errors, disconnection, and successful reconnection, ensuring that the application can monitor and react
 * appropriately to changes in database connection status.
 *
 * The function throws an exception if the initial connection attempt fails, which should be handled by the caller to
 * manage application behavior in case of database unavailability.
 *
 * @async
 * @function connect
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the database connection is successfully established,
 *                           or rejects with an error if the connection cannot be made.
 * @example
 * try {
 *     await DatabaseService.connect();
 *     console.log('Database connected!');
 * } catch (error) {
 *     console.error('Failed to connect to database:', error);
 * }
