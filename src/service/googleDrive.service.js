/**
 * @fileoverview This module provides a service for interfacing with Google Drive via the Google Drive API. It facilitates
 * uploading and deleting files in a specified Google Drive folder, leveraging the capabilities of the `@googleapis/drive`
 * library. The service utilizes OAuth2 authentication to securely access and modify resources on Google Drive based on
 * configurations defined in a separate module.
 *
 * The primary functionalities include:
 * - `uploadFile`: Handles the uploading of files to Google Drive, setting permissions to ensure that the files are
 *   shareable and retrievable via a public link. It uses a readable stream to handle file data, accommodating larger files
 *   by streaming them directly to Google Drive.
 * - `deleteFile`: Provides the capability to delete files from Google Drive by their file ID, supporting clean-up and
 *   management of files within the application's designated Google Drive folder.
 *
 * These functions are designed to encapsulate Google Drive operations in a reusable service that abstracts the
 * complexity of direct API interactions, promoting maintainability and scalability in applications that require
 * file storage and management functionalities.

/**
 * Uploads a file to Google Drive and sets it to be publicly viewable via a shareable link. This function initializes
 * a Google Drive client using authenticated credentials, then streams the file directly to Google Drive to handle
 * potentially large files efficiently. It also sets the necessary permissions to allow anyone with the link to view
 * the file. Upon successful upload, the function retrieves and returns the Google Drive file ID, the web view link,
 * and a direct download link.
 *
 * The function handles file metadata and stream setup, ensuring that the uploaded file retains its original name
 * and type as specified in the incoming file object. Errors during the upload process are caught and returned,
 * allowing calling functions to handle them appropriately.
 *
 * @async
 * @function uploadFile
 * @param {Object} file - The file object to upload, which should include buffer, originalname, and mimetype properties.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} A promise that resolves to an object containing file details such as ID and links,
 *                            or rejects with an error if the upload fails.
 * @example
 * try {
 *     const fileDetails = await GoogleDriveService.uploadFile(file);
 *     console.log('Uploaded file details:', fileDetails);
 * } catch (error) {
 *     console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
