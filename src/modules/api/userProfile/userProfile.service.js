/**
 * @fileoverview
 * This module provides the user profile service, which includes functionality to fetch user profiles based on their privacy settings.
 * The service determines which fields of the user profile are accessible depending on the requester's authentication status,
 * whether the requester is the user themselves, an admin, or a public viewer.
 *
 * The service handles different privacy settings, including public, friends, and private profiles, ensuring that users
 * can only access profiles according to their permissions.
 *
 * The module exports a single service object with the `getProfile` method to retrieve user profiles.

/**
 * Retrieves a user's profile based on the requester's authentication status and privacy settings.
 *
 * This function checks the privacy settings of the requested user's profile and determines the fields that should be accessible based on:
 * - Whether the requester is the profile owner (self)
 * - Whether the requester is an administrator
 * - Whether the requester is authenticated but not the profile owner (friends)
 * - Whether the requester is unauthenticated (public access)
 *
 * @param {Object} requester - The user making the request. Contains user details such as `_id` and `isAdmin`.
 * @param {string} username - The username of the user whose profile is to be retrieved.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - A promise that resolves to the user's profile information or an error response. The result includes:
 * - User profile details if the requester has appropriate access.
 * - Error message if the user is not found or access is forbidden.
 *
 * @throws {Error} - Throws an error if there is an issue retrieving the profile from the database.
