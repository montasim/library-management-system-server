 * with a failure status. This module is critical for managing unexpected failures during the
 * server's startup phase and ensuring that shutdown procedures are correctly executed to prevent
 * potential resource leaks or other complications.
 *
 * @requires module:initiateGracefulShutdown Utility to initiate a graceful shutdown of the server.
 * @requires module:service/logger.service Logger service for logging error information.
