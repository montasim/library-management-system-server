/**
 * @fileoverview This module configures the Helmet middleware settings for the application's Express server.
 * Helmet helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
 * This configuration specifically sets policies for the Content Security Policy (CSP) and Referrer Policy,
 * which are vital for enhancing the security of web applications by controlling resources the browser is allowed
 * to load and managing referrer information sent with requests.
 *
 * The Content Security Policy in this configuration restricts the sources from which various types of content
 * can be loaded, including scripts, images, and styles, essentially preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) and
 * data injection attacks. The Referrer Policy setting controls the amount of referrer information that is included
 * with requests made from the application to other websites, enhancing privacy and data security.

 *
 * @module helmetConfiguration
 * @property {Object} contentSecurityPolicy - Defines the sources of trusted content for the application.
 * @property {Object} referrerPolicy - Specifies how much referrer information should be included with requests.
