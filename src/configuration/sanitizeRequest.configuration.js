/**
 * @fileoverview This module configures and implements a sanitization middleware using DOMPurify with a JSDOM window object.
 * It is designed to cleanse incoming request data (body, query parameters, and URL parameters) in an Express application
 * to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities. The middleware integrates a
 * recursive sanitization function that cleans all string fields within objects, including nested objects, using DOMPurify,
 * which removes potentially malicious code from the input. This helps in securing the application by ensuring that all
 * incoming data is sanitized before any processing or storage operations.
 *
 * @requires module:dompurify Sanitizes HTML and prevents XSS attacks.
 * @requires module:jsdom Provides a DOM implementation on Node.js that DOMPurify can use to sanitize content.
 * @requires module:service/logger.service Custom logging service to handle errors and information logging.

/**
 * Recursively sanitizes all string values within an object to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
 * This function utilizes DOMPurify, configured with a JSDOM window object, to cleanse any potentially malicious
 * content from strings. The sanitization process also handles nested objects and arrays by using a recursive
 * approach and a WeakSet to avoid issues with circular references. This ensures that every string, no matter
 * how deeply nested within the object, is sanitized effectively. The function is crucial for maintaining the
 * integrity and security of data before it is processed or stored by the application.
 *
 * @param {Object} obj - The object containing potentially unsafe strings to be sanitized.
