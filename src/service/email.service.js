/**
 * @fileoverview This module configures and provides an email service for an Express application using the nodemailer
 * library. It includes functionalities to connect to an SMTP server and send emails. The service is designed to handle
 * email operations robustly, with built-in connection verification and retry mechanisms. It ensures that the application
 * can send emails reliably by maintaining a persistent connection with the email server, and automatically reconnecting
 * and retrying failed operations where necessary.
 *
 * The service initializes a transporter object with SMTP configuration details from the application's configuration module,
 * verifies the connection, and logs the status. If the initial connection fails, the service attempts to reconnect
 * periodically. For sending emails, the service checks if the transporter is initialized and, if not, throws an error.
 * It handles email sending errors by attempting to reconnect to the SMTP server and retrying the email transmission.
 *
 * Key components include:
 * - `connect`: Establishes and verifies a connection to the SMTP server.
 * - `sendEmail`: Sends an email using the established SMTP connection and handles retries if the send operation initially fails.
 *
 * This modular approach to handling email operations decouples the email functionality from the rest of the application,
 * promoting separation of concerns and making the email service easy to manage and scale.

/**
 * Establishes and verifies a connection to the SMTP server configured in the application settings. This function initializes

 * it logs the error and attempts to reconnect after a delay. This method ensures that the email service is ready and capable
 * of sending emails before any send operations are attempted.
