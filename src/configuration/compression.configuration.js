 * all requests that pass through it. This module sets specific parameters for compression
 * such as maximum level and condition-based filtering to optimize performance and control
 * data transmission efficiency. The use of this middleware can significantly reduce the size
 * of the response body, enhancing the speed of HTTP transactions particularly in environments
 * with bandwidth constraints.
