/**
 * @fileoverview This module provides caching middleware functionalities for an Express application using NodeCache.
 * It includes functions to create cache entries based on request URLs and methods, and to invalidate cache entries
 * based on specific routes. This caching mechanism enhances performance by storing the results of expensive operations
 * (typically GET requests) and serving them directly from the cache on subsequent requests, reducing the need for
 * re-execution and thus speeding up response times.
 *
 * The module defines two main functions:
 * - `create`: Dynamically generates a caching layer for requests, with a customizable duration for cache entries.
 *   It intercepts outgoing responses and caches them if they meet specific criteria (e.g., successful GET responses).
 * - `invalidate`: Provides a way to programmatically clear cached entries when data modifications occur that would
 *   render the cached data stale, such as after POST, PUT, or DELETE operations on related resources.
 *
 * These functions are essential for maintaining fresh and efficient data delivery in web applications where certain
 * responses are costly to generate and do not change frequently.

/**
 * Creates a caching middleware for Express routes that caches responses based on request URLs and methods. This function
 * allows for setting a custom duration for each cache entry. For GET requests, it attempts to retrieve a cached response and
 * serve it if available. For non-GET requests, it generates a unique cache key to store the response for future access. If a
 * response for a GET request is not found in the cache, it overrides the default res.send method to cache the new response
 * before sending it to the client. This approach enhances performance by reducing the need for repeated processing of the
 * same requests.
 *
 * @param {number} [duration=3600] - The duration in seconds for which the cache entry should remain valid.
 * @returns {Function} An Express middleware function that checks for cached data or caches new data as needed.
 * @example
 * // Usage within an Express route
 * app.get('/api/data', cacheMiddleware.create(600), (req, res) => {
 *     res.send('This is the response data');
 * });
