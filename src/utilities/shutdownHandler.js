/**
 * @fileoverview This file defines the shutdownHandler function, which is designed to handle
 * graceful shutdown of the server when it receives termination signals like SIGINT or SIGTERM.
 * The function ensures that all necessary cleanup processes, such as database disconnections,
 * are performed before shutting down the server. This module plays a critical role in
 * maintaining the integrity and consistency of the application state during shutdown,
 * preventing data loss and other issues that might arise from abrupt termination.
 *
 * @requires module:service/database.service Database service for managing database connections.
 * @requires module:initiateGracefulShutdown Utility function to facilitate a controlled shutdown.
 * @requires module:service/logger.service Logger service for logging shutdown events and errors.
