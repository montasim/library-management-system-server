/**
 * @fileoverview This module defines a collection of constants used throughout the application.
 * It centralizes various settings and predefined values, such as maximum and minimum lengths for user inputs
 * (like usernames and passwords), URLs for social media profiles, confirmation texts for critical actions,
 * and default names for roles. By centralizing these constants, the application ensures consistency and
 * reduces the likelihood of errors associated with the duplication of literal values. This approach also
 * simplifies the process of updating values as changes can be made in one place and reflected throughout
 * the application.
 *
 * The constants are organized into different categories:
 * - `lengths`: Defines the minimum and maximum allowable lengths for various user inputs.
 * - `urls`: Provides a central reference for URLs, particularly social media links.
 * - `confirmationText`: Stores specific text for confirmatory actions to prevent accidental submissions.
 * - `defaultName`: Contains default names for certain roles or identifiers in the application.
