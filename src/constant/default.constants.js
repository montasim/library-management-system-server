/**
 * @fileoverview This module defines and exports default constants used throughout the application, specifically
 * for default image URLs. It provides organized and easy-to-reference image links for various user profiles based
 * on gender. Centralizing these image URLs in a single module helps maintain consistency in default images used across
 * different parts of the application and simplifies updates or changes to these resources.
 *
 * By storing these URLs in a constants file, the application can easily manage default images without hardcoding URLs
 * multiple times throughout the codebase, thereby reducing redundancy and potential errors. This method also ensures
 * that any changes to the image sources need only be updated in one location.
