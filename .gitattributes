# This configuration file is used by Git to handle the line endings and encoding settings for files based on their type.
# It ensures consistent handling of files across different operating systems and environments.

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto
# Ensures automatic text handling, which normalizes line endings on commit and converts them on checkout.

# Specify line ending settings for specific file types to ensure consistency across platforms.
*.js text eol=crlf
*.jsx text eol=crlf
*.ts text eol=crlf
*.tsx text eol=crlf
*.json text eol=crlf
*.md text eol=crlf

# Set UTF-8 encoding for certain file types to prevent encoding issues across different environments.
*.js charset=utf-8
*.jsx charset=utf-8
*.ts charset=utf-8
*.tsx charset=utf-8
*.json charset=utf-8

# Special handling for markdown files to prevent issues with formatting that uses trailing whitespace.
*.md text=auto eol=crlf
*.md -trim_trailing_whitespace

# Define binary files to prevent Git from attempting to auto-correct line endings or apply text transformations.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.gif binary

# Explanation of binary setting
# 'binary' attribute is used to tell Git to treat the file as a binary data, preventing any automatic end-of-line conversion,
# and ensuring that the file is not modified.
